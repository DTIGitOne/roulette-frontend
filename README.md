## ABOUT
This is my biggest and best frontend project that i have started making, it is suposed to be a spin on the standard roulette whell logic with a few interesting ides to it. I am the frontend developer for the app and my frined is the backend developer for it. 
We started the project a few months ago but never got to finishing it because of time issues and so the project was left where it is currently at, but still i wanted to add the code to my portfolio because i think that the code written currently is still good 
enough to add to my portfolio.
